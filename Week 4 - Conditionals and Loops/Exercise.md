# Activity: Grade Classification

In this activity, you'll create a program to classify student grades based on their numerical scores using the following criteria:

- Scores between 90 and 100 (inclusive) are classified as "A".
- Scores between 80 and 89 (inclusive) are classified as "B".
- Scores between 70 and 79 (inclusive) are classified as "C".
- Scores between 60 and 69 (inclusive) are classified as "D".
- Scores below 60 are classified as "F".

## Instructions

1) Prompt the user to enter a numerical score (the answer should be on the board!)
2) Use if/elif/else statements to determine the grade category based on the score.
3) Display the right grade to the user.

    ```python
    user_input = int(input("Please enter a numerical score: "))

    if user_input >= 90 and user_input < 100:
        print("Grade: A")
    elif
    ... 
    ```

    ```bash
    # Example input and output
    "Please enter a numerical score: 85"
    Grade: B
    ```
