# Activity: Personalized Gretting

In this activity, you will create a personalized greeting message using only variables and print statements.

## Instructions

1) Write down three pieces of information: your name, age and favorite hobby.
1) Definite three variables called: **'name'**, **'age'**, and **'hobby'**.
1) Assign your name, age and hobby to these variables.
1) Print out your name, age and hobby using the print function

   ```python
   print("This is an example of how to use the print function!")
   ```

   ```python
   favorite_color = purple
   print("My favorite color is", favorite_color)
   ```

    Output:

    ```bash
    This is an example of how to use the print function!
    My favorite color is purple
    ```

### **Bonus Points!**

1) Use the built-in input function to prompt another user for their name, age and hobby to make a personalized greeting generator.

    ```python
    prompt = input("This will prompt the user to input a string, and will assign it to the variable 'prompt'")

    print(prompt)
    ```

    ```python
    favorite_color = input("What is your favorite color? ")

    print(favorite_color)
    ```

    The output, or return value, of the 2nd snippet would be purple. Because my favorite color is purple!
