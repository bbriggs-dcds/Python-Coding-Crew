# Week 1 - Introduction to Programming

## Goals to Accomplish

1) Introduce Progamming as a whole  

   1) What is a Programming Language -

   1) "What are some things you can make with programming", give examples
      - Games
      - Software/Applications
      - Artifical Intelligence

   1) What is Python and why should you learn it?
      - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language, best known for
its simplicity and readability. *(Interpeted meaning the source code isn't directly
translated by the computer.)*
      - Python is used in many fields of technology: web development, data science,
and artificial intelligence.
      - Python's simplicity is a big reason why beginner programmers start to learn it.
      - Versatility allows Python to be accessible and usable for many in different fields.
      - There are careers available in Web Development, Data Science and Machine Learning,
Scientific computing, Game Development and much more.

1) Kahoot!
1) Sign into Repl.it
1) First Python Program  
hello_world.py

   ```python
   print("Hello World!")
   ```

1) Variables and Data types
   - **Defintion**: A variable is a symbolic name given to pieces of data that can be later referenced or changed when the program runs. Variables help us store information that we can later use or manipulate if needed.
   - **Naming Conventions**:
     - Variable names typically start with a lowercase letter or an underscore ("_")
     - Only contains alphanumeric characters (A-z, 0-9 and "_"), no spaces!
     - Use descriptive names, they will help indicate it's purpose or usage.
     - They are case sensitive.

         ```python
         player_name = "Alice"
         player_score = 100
         ```

     - It is best practice to follow a consistent naming style (e.g., camelCase or snake_case). This will help imporve readability in the future when revisiting code.

   - Integers, floats, strings
     - Integers are whole numbers, ie 1 or 3765.
     - Floats are decimal numbers, ie 9.75 or 3.14159
     - Strings is a sequence(s) of characters, ie "Hello World" or "A"
   - How to assign a variable
     - To assign a variable we first declare the variable by defining it with a name

         ```python
         var1 = 0
         ```

         ```python
         num1 = 4
         num2 = 2
         sum_of_nums = (num1 * num2)
         print(sum_of_nums)
         ```
